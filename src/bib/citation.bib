  abstract = {Bibliographical references to online and printed articles, books, contributions to edited books and web resources generated by EndNote, Mendeley, RefWorks and Zotero were compared with manually written references according to the citation instructions in 15 biomedical journals and the NLM citation style. The fewest mistakes were detected in references generated by Zotero for 11 journals and the NLM style, while the second fewest number of mistakes was found in Mendeley. The largest number of mistakes for 9 journals was found in references generated by EndNote and in the other 4 journals the largest number of mistakes was detected in RefWorks references. With regard to the individual types of resources, the lowest number of mistakes was shown by Zotero, while RefWorks had the greatest number of mistakes. All programs had problems especially with generating the URL and the date of access in the reference to online documents. It was also found that several mistakes were caused by technical limitations of the reference managers, while other mistakes originated due to incorrect setting of the citation styles. A comparison showed that Zotero and Mendeley are the most suitable managers.},

  abstract = {In the last round of author-sharing policy revisions, Elsevier created a labyrinthine title-by-title embargo structure requiring embargoes from 12 to 48 months for authors sharing via institutional repository (IR), while permitting immediate sharing via an author's personal website or blog. At the same time, all prepublication versions are to bear a Creative Commons-Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivatives (CC-BY-NC-ND) license. At the time this policy was announced, it was criticized by many in the scholarly communication community as overly complicated and restrictive. However, this CC licensing requirement creates an avenue for subverting an embargo in the IR to achieve quicker and wider open distribution of the author's accepted manuscript (AAM). To wit, authors may post an appropriately licensed copy on their personal site or blog, at which point the author's host institution may deposit without an embargo in the IR, not through the license granted in the publication agreement, but through the CC license on the author's version, which the sharing policy mandates. This article outlines the background and rationale of the issue and discusses the benefits, workflows, and remaining questions.},

  abstract = {Altmetric indicators are increasingly present in the research landscape. Among this ecosystem of heterogeneous indicators, social reference managers have been proposed as indicators of broader use of scholarly work. However, little work has been done to understand the data underlying this indicator. The present work uses a large-scale survey to study the users of two prominent social reference managers\textemdash Mendeley and Zotero. The survey examines demographic characteristics, usage of the platforms, as well as attitudes towards key issues in scholarly communication, such as open access, peer review, privacy, and the reward system of science. Results show strong differences between platforms: Mendeley users are younger and more gender-balanced; Zotero users are more engaged in social media and more likely to come from the social sciences and humanities. Zotero users are more likely to use the platform's search functions and to organize their libraries, while Mendeley users are more likely to take advantage of some of the discovery and networking features\textemdash such as browsing papers and groups and connecting with other users. We discuss the implications of using metrics derived from these platforms as impact indicators.},

  abstract = {Reference managers, also known as citation managers, were designed to create bibliographic citations but have evolved into powerful tools for education. In addition to their core competency of easily managing in-text citations and automatically generating a list of works cited, modern reference managers can help researchers manage increasingly large libraries of portable document format (PDF) files, web pages and other documents. Users can annotate, store, organize, tag and search PDFs. These programs fetch useful associated metadata such as publication information, author lists and article abstracts. Additionally, the programs create a searchable index that can include the article abstract and often the complete text of many articles' PDFs. Modern reference managers allow for rapid creation, organization and classification of a curated collection of reference articles that can be made available anywhere, including on mobile devices. In this article the author describes how pediatric radiologists can use reference managers to facilitate learning, teaching and writing. \textcopyright{} 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},
